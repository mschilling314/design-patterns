# Design Patterns
## Introduction
This repo will serve as an implementation of the examples found in the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ABJFRG3OMV6D&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.KueZMlNMlxnKpiJVz_jRt_7FXsYyv2hmjQCQVyWBTC0QTXHGeHVJ2Aa9KlAnKzKhakX2oNblI6G962zqBk2hSj_O0DjrenXTEQNRImeXZrCWLES_55F4TFTpBdZ_Qsia2X9sQqfi1dxfEti8PKJn4FClmN-5Txxz84RkkJyW1Ra36qVO2XyvqsDuX-gH3W-ij8qqIciDpyoy2EiexfUhi-IjHH3k8RYyVPULptWEAiE.RY0JDeu1JO60Xry9x0l4uSpqBUVcnbyeKTz1caeSrZE&dib_tag=se&keywords=head+first+design+patterns&qid=1739922329&sprefix=head+first+de%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1) in C++, to ensure that I master both C++ and the design patterns outlined.  In the future I may come back and re-do them in other languages I might need to learn.  Each pattern will get its own directory within this repository, with a brief outline of what the pattern is in its own README.

In some instances, there will be extra solutions in the case where I think the pattern is sub-optimal for the example problem given, such as the Decorator pattern.  In that case, each solution will be separated into their own directory, and another README will be provided explaining the pattern, the solutions, and why I believe my own solution to be more optimal for that particular problem.

## Running Solutions
All solutions should be functional, you can run them from the command line/terminal by navigating to the directory (exammple from project root: ```cd Decorator/Alternative\ Solution```) and then doing ```./main.exe```
